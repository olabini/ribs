- Think about unit of work
- Helper to create model objects:

R(Track).define_accessors
Ribs::define_model :Track

- Ribs should allow advanced functionality such as Unit of Work, Repository, Data Mapper, but also scale down to Active Record level
- Add logging
- More than one Ribs definition per model
